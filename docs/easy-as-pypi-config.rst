.. (lb): This file is *not* generated like easy_as_pypi_config.rst, modules.rst, etc.
..
..       Rather, this file was copyied from a generated docs/easy_as_pypi_config.rst
..       and altered with additional options.
..
..       - Note that the Sphinx and autodoc extension docs suggest these options
..         should be settable via docs/conf.py, but I had no such success.
..
..       - See comment in Makefile docs-html re: controlling which auto-generated
..         files are created.
